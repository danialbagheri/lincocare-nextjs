      "At Linco Care Ltd, we care deeply about the environment and we've been ISO 14001 - Environmental Management accredited since July 2008! We're determined to do our part in reducing our carbon footprint and using more renewable energy. That's why we've invested in a new 2356 sq meter warehouse at our Manchester site. We're excited about this investment and we hope it will help us make a positive impact on the environment.",

      "Our building is super efficient, with an 'A' grade! We've topped it off with a 100 KW peak Photovoltaic system on the roof, producing 76,900 KW hours a year. That means our carbon output is reduced by a massive 34,000 KG of Co2.",
    description2:
      "The system consists of 400 Trina Solar 250 watt panels and is installed on a South East facing roof between the skylights allowing natural daylight into the warehouse. The system also utilities four Power-One inverters to convert the DC power to AC and feed it back into our system. The company is therefore in a position to use all of the energy produced during daylight working hours and then export power back to the Grid when we are closed. By installing energy efficient lighting with daylight controls we have also reduced our power use in the new warehouse and we are looking to replicate these savings throughout our premises.",
