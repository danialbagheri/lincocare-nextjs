        <p>
          At Linco Care, we take pride in achieving the highest 'A' Grade
          efficiency standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our 100 KW peak Photovoltaic system installed on our rooftop produces
          76,900 KW hours annually, translating to a remarkable reduction of
          34,000 KG of CO2 emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system comprises 400 Trina Solar 250-watt panels installed on a
          South East facing roof, positioned between skylights to maximise
          natural daylight within the warehouse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Four Power-One inverters efficiently convert DC power to AC,
          seamlessly integrating it into our operational system. This setup
          enables us to utilise all the energy generated during working hours
          and even export surplus power back to the Grid during our
          non-operational hours. Furthermore, by installing energy efficient
          lighting with daylight controls, we have also reduced our power
          consumption. This initiative serves as a blueprint for extending
          similar energy-saving measures throughout our entire premises.
